# Privacy-Preserving Analytics Platform

## Overview

The Privacy-Preserving Analytics Platform enables organizations and users to analyze data and gain insights—such as statistics, trends, and patterns—**without exposing sensitive or personal information**. It is a privacy-first alternative to traditional analytics tools like Tableau or PowerBI.

---

## Core Features

- **Data Input**: Users can upload datasets (CSV, JSON, etc.) via a simple web interface.
- **Privacy Layer**: Before any analytics are performed, the platform applies privacy-preserving techniques:
	- **Differential Privacy**: Adds controlled noise to results so individual entries cannot be traced.
	- **Anonymization / Masking**: Removes or masks personal identifiers from the data.
- **Analytics Engine**: Performs standard analytics and machine learning on the processed data:
	- Summaries: counts, averages, distributions
	- Insights: trends, correlations, predictions (optional)
- **Dashboard Output**: Users view analytics results in a dashboard—**never the raw sensitive data**.

---

## Example Use Case

A company wants to analyze employee performance data but cannot expose names or IDs. The platform allows them to:

- Upload an anonymized dataset
- View trends such as:
	- "Average project completion time: 5.2 days"
	- "Team A has 20% higher efficiency than Team B"
- All analytics are performed in a privacy-preserving manner.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Backend & Data Handling**: Python, Flask, Pandas
- **Privacy & Security Concepts**: Differential privacy, anonymization
- **Data Analytics / Visualization**: Pandas, HTML dashboard (Plotly/D3.js/React optional)
- **Optional**: Machine learning for trend prediction
